           <p>The Exception Resolution page is divided into 3 distinct regions.</p>
           <p>  Region 1 is used to resolve Exceptions.</p>
           <p>  Region 2 is a grid display of the Receipt transactions for the exception item at the branch.</p>
           <p>  Region 3 is Exception selection screen. Exceptions are displayed 1 by 1 with the numbers at the bottom of
           the screen used to select an exception.</p>
          <br />
           <p>Upon entry into the Exception screen the first exception is selected from Region 3 
           and displayed in Regions 1.</p>
           <p>There are 3 options for resolving an exception: </p>
           <p>  The default resolution is to Accept the calculated average cost.
           To do so Click OK with ACCEPT selected in Resolution Drop Down Menu.</p>
           <p>  Select ADMINADJ from the Resolution Drop Down Menu, then enter a new Average Cost in the NewAC box.
           Click OK to create the adjustment for the Average cost entered</p>
           <p>  Select REVERSE from the Resolution Drop Down Menu to revert to the item / branch previous average cost value.
           Click OK to Create the adjustment to restore the prior Average Cost</p>
           <p>To skip resolution of an adjustment Click the next adjustmernt number in the Region 3 
           selection area without pressing OK for the adjustment currently displayed</p>
           <p>Once an adjustment is resolved the adjustment entry region 1 displays the
           next Exception. </p>
           <br />
           <p>To add an Average Cost Adjustment for which there is no Exception, Click New. This allows you to create an Administrative adjustment for 
           any branch Item by entering the Location and item numner. The Item is entered with leading zeroes and dashes example: 00200-2532-401</p>
           <br />
           <p>If you close the Exception entry screen before resolving all exceptions, when you return 
           only the un-resolved exceptions are displayed. </p>
           
           <br />
           <p>To select the next adjustment click on a number below the Region 3 adjustment selection.
           An ellipsis that appears after the last selection number indicates there are additional exceptions to display.
           Click on the ellipsis to show the next exception and the additional exception numbers.</p><br/>
           <p>When an adjustment is selected for resolution, the historical receipts for the Branch / Item
           are displayed in the Region 2 grid. If more receipts than can de displayed in the Region 2 area
           of the screen are present, the vertical scroll bar can be used to scroll the receipts display. 
           Region 2 is for reference in determining the appropriate resolution of the exception. Receipt
           history is displayed by descending receipt processing date.</p>
