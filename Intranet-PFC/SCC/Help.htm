                                The right half of the screen will show you the calclulated costs and allow you to

                                You can also export the data to Excel or print a report. These are explained at

                                The Category Groups are the same ones used on the Customer Activity Sheets. Select
                                a group using the pull down. The first and last categorsy in the group are
                                shown as well as the first category description. Set the Velocity Code, Package or Plating filters (optional).
                                Press the OK button in the blue area that says "Get SCC Adders" and the SCC Option
                                record will be retireved (if one is on file). The Status line at the top will tell
                                you if the option record was found or if this is a New Option Record.</p>

                                These are Discount Reciprocal, Velocity Adder, Premium Category Adder, and Packaging
                                Adder. <strong>These are percentages.</strong> 
                                The values in these fields are to be entered in the format ##.##.
                                E.G. If you want to enter a 3.3% Velocity Adder then enter 3.3 into the Velocity Adder field.
                                Here are the formulas for how these adders are used:</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Base Cost</strong> = Alt Price X Discount Reciprocal X ((Preferred
                                Vendor Anticipated Landed Cost - Direct Unit Cost)/ Direct Unit Cost)[aka the landing
                                adder percent]

                                <strong>Bulk Standard Cost</strong> = Base Cost + Velocity Adder + Premium Category
                                Adder + Landing Adder&nbsp;<br />
                                <strong>Package Standard Cost</strong> = Bulk Standard Cost (From bulk part in the
                                BOM) + Packaging Adder
                                + Landing Adder&nbsp;<br />
                                For Package Items where no Bulk Cost exists, we will use the Base Cost for the Package
                                Item + Velocity Adder + Premium Category Adder &nbsp;</p>

                                <strong>Updating the SCC Options:</strong> If you are creating a new SCC Option
                                record or changing an old one, you must remember to update the record. The record
                                does not update automatically. This allows you to play with different option values.
                                Once you have the calculations the way you like them and you want to save the SCC
                                Option, press the Update button in the blue area that says "Update (Save) SCC Options".
                                This will save the option values so the are ready the next time you are working
                                with this Category Group. <strong>Please remember to press the Update button or your
                                    changes to the SCC options will be lost.</strong>

                                <strong>Item Number:</strong><br />
                                <strong>Direct:</strong> The Alt Price from the Purchase Prices. This price is shown in the Puchasing UOM.<br />
                                <strong>Base:</strong> Using the formula from above.<br />
                                <strong>Bought: </strong>This is the begining date for the Purchase Price.<br />
                                <strong>Origin:</strong> This indicates whether the price was derived by using the Purchase
                                Price for the part or
                                the BOM for the part. This applies to Package Parts only.
                                All Bulk Parts are from the Purchase Prices. Package Prices that are derived from
                                the Purchase Price are colored blue.<br />
                                <strong>Standard Cost:</strong> This is calculated using the formulas above and
                                can be changed.<br />
                                <strong>Ignore:</strong> Check this box if you do not want the price to update the
                                system when the Cost Update is run.</p>
                            <p>
                                You can make any changes you want to the Standard Costs and set any number of lines
                                to be ignored in the Cost Updates. If there is a UOM issue that keeps the Alt Price from
                                being shown, the costs will be set to zero and you will not be able to update this record.</p>
