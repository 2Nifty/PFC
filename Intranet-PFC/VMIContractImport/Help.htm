                                This page allows you to do mass loads for VMI Contracts from an Excel spreadsheet. The
                                spreadsheets have to be put in a specific folder to be loaded. The folder is on the page behind this one. You can load anything
                                that is already in this folder or you can browse and load a new file. To reload a file that is already in the Contract folder, use the Review link to 
                                the left of the file name.</p>
                                <p>If you are using Excel and making changes to a file on the H: drive, you have to copy, review, and update the contract in the system. You have to 
                                save the Excel file, close the Excel file,
                                use the Browse button to find the file on the H: drive, press the OK button to review the changes, and finally press Update to apply the contract.
                                </p>
                                
                            <p>
            Find the Excel VMI Contract file you want to load using the Browse button then press the OK
    button to load the contract in the Excel file to this page. If you do not see the file you just copied, refresh the page
    using the refresh button for the browser.</p>

                    <br />
                You have to use a special spreadsheet that has the right layout and names. Using the 
                wrong spreadsheet will cause the process to fail.<p>
                The basic process is to: <br />
                Find the file you want to load.<br />
                Press the OK button to see the contract contents on this page.<br />
                If it is all OK, use the Update button to actually update the system.</p>
</strong></p>
                            <p>Prices already on file for a contract will be replaced.
