           <p>You are here to reprint/repick a NewVision Sales or Transfer Order.</p>
The NewVision Sales Order is in the form of SO???????. Some old Sales Orders are ??????-2004 or ??????-2005.
The NewVision Transfer Order is in the form of TO???????. 
If you are trying to print a shipper from anything other than a sales order or transfer order, this process will not work.
This process ONLY works on Sales and Transfer Orders. Also, this process will fail is the sales order has already been invoiced.
<p>
You have to select the location (Branch) for the shippers you are reprinting/repicking.
This can be either the location that is shipping the shipper or the location that entered the shipper. You can select this by either selecting 
Shipping or Order on the radio buttons to the right of the Branch list.</p>
You can enter a range of SO or TO numbers. If you enter only a beginning shipper number, the selection with be for
any shipper greater than or equal to the shipper number you entered. If you enter only an ending shipper number,
any shipper less than or equal to the number you entered will be selected.<p></p>
The date range is defaulted to the last week. If you want to look at only today's shippers, make the start and end dates
today's date. You can select on either the date the order went through The RB Pipe or the order date.<p></p>
Once you get the selection the way you like it, press the button that says "OK" next to the Help button. 
After you press the button, the system will try to find your order. 
If it succeeds, you will be given a chance to resubmit it on the next screen.<p></p>
You will also see an OK button on a line that says 'View Most Recent Entries'. This option is more technical and not as friendly
as using the first selection screen.<p></p>
If only one order is found, you will be shown the information about the shipper.
You can choose to reprint or repick by using the button at the bottom of the page. 
Reprint means the shipper will be reprinted at the shipping branch, but not
sent down to Radio Beacon. Repicking means that you will get a reprint of the shipper and the order will be
sent down to Radio Beacon. There is a catch, if Radio Beacon has already seen the order, it will not
process it twice. If you are trying to get another copy of an order you accidentally nuked, you will have to talk to someone
who can make Radio Beacon ready to receive a second copy of the order.<p></p>
If your selection finds more than one order, you will see a page with a list of orders that matched your selection. You have to
flag the orders to want to have reprinted or repicked. There is a button at the top of the page that will allow you to flag all the 
orders to be reprinted or repicked. Once the records you want to process are flagged, you have to press the Update button to 
actually resubmit the orders 
to The RB Pipe.<p></p>
<i>Using this screen does not ensure that that shipper will actually reprint. It is possible that the job that hands off these requests is dead
and that is why shippers aren't printing.</i><p></p>
<b>THERE IS A DELAY!. All you do when you use this screen is set a tracking record. The job that actually takes care of the request may 
take 5 to 10 minutes to find your request and get it all the way to the printer.</b>
